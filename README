This is an dot matrix LCD driver for the DOGM128 built by Electronic 
Assembly, it may work with any other LCD module that uses the ST756R 
controller chip.

The code is written in C for the HI-TECH C compiler but it should be
easily adaptable to any other as long as you take care of word length
and other issues. The original target is a 16 bit Microchip PIC 
PIC16F1936 microproccesor.

A complete CP437 based, 7x5 pixels font is provided, along with big 
48x30 pixels digits from 0 to 9. (The driver was written for an 
instrument panel)

In the tools folder you will find a bash script that converts 1bpp BMP
files to C header files, this script was used to generate the fonts.
The source bitmap for the digits is also included, along with an example
output which happens to be an 1bpp picture of my lovely girlfriend.

Some additional wrappers and headers are provided for the USART and SPI
interfaces, mainly for reference.
